    <h1>Hello,Welcome to my Website!</h1>

    <p>
      Hello Everyone, Welcome to my Website! I am gradually updating this site
      upcoming days. I find myself learning new skills and programming
      languages, problem-solving, responsive design principles, website
      optimization, software engineering, and Model View Controller (MVC)
      methods of organizing code. I have experience using Java, Javascript,
      Azure Fundamental, Node.js, ReactJS, and I've started diving into lambda
      functions on AWS and RESTful APIs. I am enthusiastically open to learn new
      programming languages, frameworks, and libraries and work on positions
      that get me involved in any creative and technical areas.
    </p>
